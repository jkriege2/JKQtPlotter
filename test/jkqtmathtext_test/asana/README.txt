The "Asana Math" OpenType font includes all mathematical symbols
included in the latest version of Unicode. It includes a MATH t
able as an extension to OpenType that would enable selecting glyphs 
for stretchy operators in a not-so-font-specific manner. It has 
been successfully tested with XeTeX 0.9997.4 and Word 2007/2010. 
The font was constructed using glyphs from the pxfonts of Young Ryu 
while many symbols were designed by the author. The name  Asana 
(Ἀσάνα, Asána) is the name of the mythological goddess Athena in 
the Doric dialect. The font is almost finished, but it is quite 
possible that users may find bugs and/or problems. Anyone who will 
find a bug or a problem, should contact the author and report her 
findings. The TrueType version of the font is provided for people
using Word and should not be included in a standard TeX installation.
