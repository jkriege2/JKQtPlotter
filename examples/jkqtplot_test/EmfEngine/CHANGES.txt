EmfEngine was completely rewritten using the Windows GDI+ API. The old implementation using Windows GDI (also provided by libEMF on Unix-like systems) is still available if you disable the HAVE_GDI_PLUS option in EmfEngine.pro.
This new implementation adds the following features:
	- Antialiasing
	- Antialiased texts (if the option HAVE_ANTIALIASED_TEXT is enabled in EmfEngine.pro)
	- Transparent brushes
	- Support for Qt::LinearGradientPattern and Qt::RadialGradientPattern

13/04/2009 - Release 0.2:

- Implemented drawImage().
- Implemented drawTiledPixmap().
- Improved drawPixmap().
- Implemented rendering of QBrush with style set to Qt::TexturePattern.
- Improved paths handling in drawPath().
- Fixed polyline drawing in drawPolygon().
- Modified the example to make use of the new features.
