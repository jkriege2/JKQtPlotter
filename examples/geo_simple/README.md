# Example (JKQTPlotter): Generating Demo-Plots of Geometric Objects for Documentation                                      {#JKQTPlotterGeometricGraphsSimple}



This project contains code that is used to generate the example graphs for geometric objects from teh documentation.

The source code of the main application can be found in  [`geo_simple.cpp`](https://github.com/jkriege2/JKQtPlotter/tree/master/examples/geo_simple/geo_simple.cpp).
